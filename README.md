## ✨ Overview

Many online QR tools advertise themselves as “free,”  
but later demand payment to keep your QR codes active.  
This project was built to **end that lock-in problem**.

**Open QR Generator** creates QR codes entirely **on your device**,  
without uploading data to any server or API.  
The generated QR is **yours forever** — once you print or save it,  
it will **always work**, no matter where it’s hosted.
